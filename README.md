- [Adafruit FPC Stick - 20 Pin 0.5mm/1.0mm Pitch Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1325)
- [Adafruit Multi-pitch FPC Adapter - 40 Pin 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8/1.0mm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1436)
- [Adafruit 50 pin 0.5mm pitch FPC Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1492)

Connect to 0.5mm, 1.0mm and even some 2.0mm pitch connectors that you may run across with an FPC stick. We designed this for use in house, to quickly connect to FPCs we need to test. But we also thought it might be useful for our customers. On either side is a 20 pin 0.5 or 1.0mm pitch connector with long pads and one very long 'mechanical' pad. Each pad is broken out to a 20-pin long 0.1" spaced header. It can accommodate most ZIF and snap connectors and will make prototyping much easier on you!

You will roll lucky 7's and connect to nearly any kind of FPC/flex cable with Ladyada's Super Lucky 40-pin FPC to breadboard adapter plate. You get 40 pads of 0.5mm, 0.6mm, 0.7mm, 0.8mm or 1.0mm. It may even work for some 2.0mm pitch connectors. We designed this for use in house, to quickly connect to FPCs we need to test. But we also thought it might be useful for our customers. Each pad is broken out to both a 2x20 0.1" spaced header as well as two strips of 20-pin long 0.1" spaced header 2.1" inches apart. It can accommodate most ZIF and snap connectors or just solder the FPC directly on. This adapter will make prototyping much easier on you!

Connect to those pesky 0.5mm pitch connectors that you may run across with an FPC stick. We designed this for use in house, to quickly connect to 50pin 0.5mm pitch flex cables we need to test. But we also thought it might be useful for our customers. There's a 50-pin long connector on top, and we have one very long 'mechanical' pad. Since the pad extends along the entire length you can use any size 0.5mm pitch connector you wish, we seem to bump into 40 and 50 pin the most. Each pad is broken out to a 25-pin long 0.1"x0.1" spaced header. One side is doubled on the opposite side to make it bread-board friendly. It can accommodate most ZIF and snap connectors and will make prototyping much easier on you!
